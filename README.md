eBay-Kleinanzeigen Full Size Image is a simple chrome extension which helps you extract all the images from web page and view them in original size. No more hassle to search each image from a page source.

This extension allows you to :
- Preview all images as thumbnail.
- Open all images in original size (open in new tab).
- Easily download images (Right Click -> Save Image As..).

Important Note: this extension does NOT belong or related to the official eBay-Kleinanzeigen application/website in any ways. It is an unofficial app that is developed and maintained independently.

This chrome extension was first made for private use, and later I decide to share it with the rest of the world.
Any suggestions and comments are welcome ❤️

Happy scrapping!
